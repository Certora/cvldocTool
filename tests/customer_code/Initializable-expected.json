        "text": "## Verification of Initializable\r\n\r\n`Initializable` is a contract used to make constructors for upgradeable\r\ncontracts. This is accomplished by applying the `initializer` modifier to any\r\nfunction that serves as a constructor, which makes this function only\r\ncallable once. The secondary modifier `reinitializer` allows for upgrades\r\nthat change the contract's initializations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Assumptions and Simplifications\r\nWe assume `initializer()` and `reinitializer(1)` are equivalent if they\r\nboth guarentee `_initialized` to be set to 1 after a successful call. This\r\nallows us to use `reinitializer(n)` as a general version that also handles\r\nthe regular `initialzer` case.\r\n\r\n#### Harnessing\r\nTwo harness versions were implemented, a simple flat contract, and a\r\nMulti-inheriting contract. The two versions together help us ensure there are\r\nNo unexpected results because of different implementions. Initializable can\r\nBe used in many different ways but we believe these 2 cases provide good\r\nCoverage for all cases. In both harnesses we use getter functions for\r\n`_initialized` and `_initializing` and implement  `initializer` and\r\n`reinitializer` functions that use their respective modifiers. We also\r\nImplement some versioned functions that are only callable in specific\r\nVersions of the contract to mimick upgrading contracts.\r\n\r\n#### Munging\r\nVariables `_initialized` and `_initializing` were changed to have internal\r\nvisibility to be harnessable."
