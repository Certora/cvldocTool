The contract was verified as part\nof previous work with OpenZeppelin and is included here for the purposes of\nincreased verification coverage with respect to token transfer methods.\n\n### Assumptions and Simplifications\n- Internal burn and mint methods are wrapped by CVT callable functions.\n\n### Properties\n\nThese properties are additions to the previous `ERC1155` verification.\nPlease see the file ERC1155.spec for earlier contract properties verified."
